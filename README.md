# Mobile-first Responsive Layout

## This project is part of the TreeHouse Tech Degree program which focuses on writing html, and css.
## The css is written with mobile-first in mind.
## I have set up media queries at 768px and 1024px for medium to large screens.

To run, simply download the zip files and open the index.html file.
